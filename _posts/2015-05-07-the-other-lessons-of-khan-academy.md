As I was catching up on some old posts that have been sitting in my rss reader for ever [this article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/howardhusock/2014/10/28/reclaiming-the-american-dream-vi-the-other-lessons-of-khan-academy/) caught my eye because it shows how one mans disruptive idea really can make an impact, and that the time to disrupt education is now!

> To say that Khan Academy has important lessons to offer is to state the obvious. The Mountain View-based internet teaching institution—which has grown from founder Salman Khan’s individualized YouTube math lessons for his 7th grade niece to a worldwide phenomenon—offers thousands of free, plain-spoken online courses, from algebra to biology

And it only gets better as we read on

> In other words, Khan Academy has done something different—and more far-reaching—than starting another social service program which signs up clients. It’s providing the tools for self-improvement; by doing so, it’s spreading the word that one can, in fact, do just that. Put another way, Khan is trying to change the conventional view about how education works.
