I came across this in my daily news feed and it always excites me when someone else shares the same (or a similar vision) as me.

In the [linked article](http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/03/the-deconstruction-of-the-k-12-teacher/388631/) titled "The Deconstruction of the K-12 Teacher" and published on [The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/) website the author [Michael Godsey](http://www.theatlantic.com/author/michael-godsey/) gives us his vision of the teacher of the future:

> Whenever a college student asks me, a veteran high-school English educator, about the prospects of becoming a public-school teacher, I never think it’s enough to say that the role is shifting from "content expert" to "curriculum facilitator." Instead, I describe what I think the public-school classroom will look like in 20 years, with a large, fantastic computer screen at the front, streaming one of the nation’s most engaging, informative lessons available on a particular topic.

Spot on! The author then proceeds to describe his vision of the "virtual class" and the concept of a "super teacher":

> The "virtual class" will be introduced, guided, and curated by one of the country’s best teachers (a.k.a. a "super-teacher"), and it will include professionally produced footage of current events, relevant excerpts from powerful TedTalks, interactive games students can play against other students nationwide, and a formal assessment that the computer will immediately score and record.

Go on and read the [full article](http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/03/the-deconstruction-of-the-k-12-teacher/388631/) to get some inspiration.
